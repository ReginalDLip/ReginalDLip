#I'm currently a 5th-semester Computer Science student at BINUS University, specializing in Game Application and Technology (GAT). Over the past two semesters in this specialization, I've significantly improved my game development skills, primarily using Unity.

A little bit about myself: I'm driven by a strong curiosity for things I don't know yet, and I enjoy diving into hard and complex subjects.

Currently, I am expanding my skillset by participating in a Data Scientist program from the DBS Foundation. Through this, I aim to learn new technologies and broaden my future career paths beyond game development.
